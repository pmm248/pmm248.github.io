		    <p> As part of a computer graphics course offered at Cornell, I worked with a partner to implement a ray tracer in Java. A ray tracer renders a computer image by simulating the way light propogates through space and interacts with objects. Given a three-dimensional triangle mesh, the ray tracer renders the scene along with shadows, light reflectance, and textures. The ray tracer supports orthogonal and perspective viewing, along with multiple surface shading models. My role in the project involved implementing ray generation, ray intersection, as well as computing shading during the rendering process. </p>

		    <p> Expanding on the shading models covered throughout the course, I implemented a Blinn-Phong shader, a Cook-Torrance shader, as well as shaders based on environment mapping, normal mapping, and displacement mapping. </p>

        <p> ConsTableaux is an automated theorem prover, proof visualizer, and educational tool based off of the method of analytic tableaux. It was implemented as a team of three in Scala and JavaScript. Given a formula in propositional logic, ConsTableaux proves whether or not it is a tautology, and generates an interactive, step-by-step tree visualization of a proof or counter-example. The project aims to help students who have trouble grasping the underlying intuition behind proofs of propositional logic by presenting them through a visual medium. I worked on the backend of this project, and was responsible for implementing the parser and the core logic behind proof evaluation. ConsTableaux was created under the supervision of Professor Robert Constable and was featured at Bits On Our Minds 2017. </p>

        <p> Conceived at the RIT BrickHack Hackathon, and winning the Best Pebble Hack Award, Pokemon Pebble Edition brings the virtual Pokemon world to reality, using geolocation and player movement to create a location-based version of the classic videogame. Players can battle and capture Pokemon in the real world using their Pebble smartwatch, and use their Android smartphone as a Pokedex. I was responsible for developing all game mechanics on the Pebble smart watch, as well as integrating sensor data from the Android handset into game events. Despite high interest in further development, Pokemon Pebble was discontinued in late 2015 once Pokemon Go was announced, due to a large overlap in content.</p>
